#  Heart Disease Detection using Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning algorithms to predict the presence of heart disease in patients based on various medical attributes. The aim is to assist in early detection and risk assessment, potentially saving lives through timely intervention.


## Dataset

The dataset used is the **Cleveland Heart Disease dataset** from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+Disease).

It contains **14 attributes**, including:
- Age
- Sex
- Chest pain type (cp)
- Resting blood pressure (trestbps)
- Serum cholesterol (chol)
- Fasting blood sugar (fbs)
- Resting electrocardiographic results (restecg)
- Maximum heart rate achieved (thalach)
- Exercise-induced angina (exang)
- ST depression induced by exercise (oldpeak)
- Number of major vessels (ca)
- Thalassemia (thal)
- ... and the target variable: `1` (disease) or `0` (no disease)

# Machine Learning Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Decision Tree
- Gradient Boosting (Optional)

We evaluate the models using metrics such as:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- ROC-AUC Curve


# Results

The best-performing model in our experiment achieved:
- **Accuracy**: 86%
- **Precision**: 88%
- **Recall**: 85%
- **F1 Score**: 86%
